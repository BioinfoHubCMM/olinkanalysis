## R and Rstudio basics
If you are not familiar with R and Rstudio, we recomend going over the following tutorials before the seminar:  
1) [Getting started with R and Rstudio](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/tutorial-getting-started-with-r-and-rstudio/)  
2) [Basic basics](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/01-basicbasics-0/)  
3) [Clean it up](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/02-cleanitup-0/)  

## Dataset
A synthetic dataset with 500 individuals has been artificially generated using as reference a human dataset consisting of 92 human protein biomarkers from the Proseek Multiplex CVD 1 Olink panel. The toy dataset can be found in the docs/ folder in this repository.

## Learning objectives
In this workshop we will use the dataset to:  
  1) **Compare OLINK protein profiles between cases and controls, as well as between the disease sub-groups:**  Disease subgroups have been adjusted to mimic those of [Diaz-Gallo et. al. 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34658170/).
  2) **Investigate whether there is a significant different between protein profiles between males and females**  
  3) **Investigate if differences between protein profiles across subgroups may be influced by treatment of two commonly used drugs to treat SLE**
