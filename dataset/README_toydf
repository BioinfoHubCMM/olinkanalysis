Description:
A synthetic dataset with 500 individuals has been artificially generated using as reference a human dataset consisting of 92 human protein biomarkers from the Proseek Multiplex CVD 1 Olink panel. 

olink_toy_dataset:
Protein values have been generated by randomly drawing values from a real dataset, adding a constant value and random noise from a normal distribution. The reference dataset protein values consisted of Normalized Protein Expression (NPX) values. In the reference dataset NPX values are obtained by normalizing cq-values against extension control, interplate control and a correction factor.
NPX values were on log2scale where a high NPX value corresponded to a higher protein concentration and could be linearized by using the formula 2^NPX.
Clinical variables are presented in columns A-F, while each protein is presented in columns G-CT.
